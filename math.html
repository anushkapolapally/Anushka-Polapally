        <h2>Athemath</h2>
        <p>Currently working on developing an optimal iterative refinement pipeline for open source LLMs with the mentorship of members from the <a href="https://agenticlearning.ai/">NYU Agentic AI Lab</a>. This project was started in the <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/gstem/about-us/">NYU GSTEM program</a>.</p>
        <p>Through this project, I hope to democratize access to high quality LLMs and enable user-data transparency while using LLMs. The work focuses on creating systems that allow for continuous improvement of model outputs through structured feedback loops.</p>

        <h2>Tompkins Math Contest Team</h2>
        <p>Previously worked on creating a methodology for similarity matching inspired by ArCADia, a project I proposed during the Conrad Challenge. This project was done under the mentorship of a professor at Texas A&M.</p>
        <p>The research explored novel approaches to pattern recognition and matching algorithms, with applications in architectural design and spatial analysis.</p>

        <h2>Mu Alpha Theta</h2>
        <p>Investigated how machine learning can solve inverse problems for image classification under the mentorship of Andreas Mang. The work explored computational techniques for reconstructing input features from classification outputs.</p>
        <p>Findings were documented in a comprehensive final report detailing the mathematical foundations and practical applications of inverse problem solving in computer vision.</p>
