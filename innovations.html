        <h2>ArCADia</h2>
        <p>For the 24-25 Conrad Challenge and the 24-25 Blue Ocean Entrepreneurship Contest, I developed an AI assisted CAD developement platform aimed towards accelerating hardware developement.</p>
        <p>I noticed that AI tools such as Copilot, have significantly sped up software developement and that there was no parralel for hardware developement.</p>
        <p>This project consisted of prototyping the innovation, doing market analysis, and creating business strategy. I continued the full developement of this project at Texas A&M.</p>
        <p>For the creation of ArCAdia, I won the <strong>Conrad Innovator Award</strong> and <strong>Blue Ocean Top 350 out of ~12,000 students</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Peared v1</h2>
        <p>For the 24-25 Diamond Challenge social innovation category, I created Peared v1(different from my org Peared). </p>
        <p>Peared v1 was a digital platform that organized volunteering efforts towards creating socialization for immobile seniors. We noticed that seniors unable to afford care in senior living facilities had significantly higher rates of depression, cognitive decline, and amnesia partially due to their social isolation. </p>
        <p>
          Our platform split the various tasks needed such as event organization, transportation, and clean up into microtasks that volunteers could sign up for. This allowed for more people to volunteer as they could pick and choose tasks that fit their schedule.
          We assigned volunteers to assist in transportation based on thier geographical region. This reduced travel time and increased the number of seniors we could serve.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the creation of Peared v1, I was a <strong>Diamond Challenge Semifinalist</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I realized the orgaizational framework we created for Peared v1 could be applied to a wider range of volunteering opportunities, which led to the creation of my nonprofit Peared.

        <h2>K9 Assist</h2>
        <p>For the 24-25 Technovation hackathon (an all girls youth hackathon), I created K9 Assist which is an app that aids in the training of service dogs. I saw how expensive the training of service dogs was due to the expertise needed. I wanted to create an alternative accessbile option to this training based on industry standards and incremental progress checking. </p>
        <p>I also had to analye the innovation through different business cocnepts and compose my findings in a business brief.</p>
        <p>The app contained a curriculum based on the industry standards and Machine Learning powered checkpoints that would track progress after each module. These checks would involve using a video of the dog and an Ultralytics model to check if the dogs final position of the eercise was correct.</p>
        <p>For the creation of K9 Assist, I was a <strong>Technovation Octofinalist</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Clarity</h2>
        <p>For the 25-26 Conrad Challenge, I am creating Clarity which is an accessible low-cost water filter and detector for microplastics. The average person can consume up to 74,000 microplastics through their tap-water. We wanted to find a way to combat this issue both on the macro and micro scale.</p>
        <p>Clarity will help facilitate large scale on-site data collection that will be part of a citizens science project to target problematic water processing sites leaking microplastics. It will be low cost compared to traditional detection methods by using lasers and cameras to perform optical scattering. We will also have a compatible mobile app that will display a map of data points, an individuals water micro-plastic levels, and individualized reccomendations.</p>
